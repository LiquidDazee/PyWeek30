# The Loast Coast: Developed for PyWeek 30

## Why does this game exist?
Besides the fact that we wanted to take up a challenge from the Python community and do something random, we've all had an innate interest in games and game development to an extent. [PyWeek](https://pyweek.org/) is a bi-annual game jam that promotes writing games for fun in Python, so when the opportunity came, it was hard to pass up.

## Getting Started
To install this game, first clone this git repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Not-Pace/PyWeek30.git
```

Navigate to the folder and make a quick virtual environment to run the game:

```shell
virtualenv .game
```

On UNIX/Linux/WSL:
```shell
source .game/bin/activate
```

On Windows
```shell
source .game/Scripts/activate
```

Install all the dependencies from the  `requirements.txt` folder.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run main.py to run the game!

```shell
python main.py
```
